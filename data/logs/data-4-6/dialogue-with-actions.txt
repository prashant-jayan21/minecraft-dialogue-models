<Architect> we first begin with the color blue
<Architect> make a vertical 2x2 square on the platform
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> anywhere?
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perferably more left of
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> thats fine
<Architect> ok now look at the blue square from the center of the platform
<Architect> place 4 blocks directly vertical of the top right blue block. these blocks are also blue
<Builder> ok so looks like a d?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> yes like a d. place a block to the right of the highest blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:6 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes. ok now make an exact copy of this except in purple. Additionally, the exact copy needs to be one block higher than the blue.
<Builder> where?
<Architect> the exact copy is right next to the blue one on the right
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> here?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> yes, but remember to move the copy up by one block
<Builder> so its a longer tail in the d?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:5 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> so remove the bottom 2 purple blocks
<Architect> ok remove the thing sticking out on the right of the purple one. my bad
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:7 Z:4]
<Architect> and just move it to the left of the highest purple block
<Builder> on the opposite side?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:7 Z:2]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> ok what you have is perfect. we're done
<Builder> good

B1-A44-C67-1523034590730
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hello
<Architect> begin by placing 2 yellow blocks flat on the ground. place them near the center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> is this ok?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now place 2 more blocks vertically on top of the yellow block on the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> inverse L?
<Architect> yeah it's an inverse L. perfect. Now 2 more blocks to the right of the 2 blocks you just placed
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah that's fine. place 1 block in the corner
<Architect> the corner that isn't the L
<Architect> this structure is completely 2 dimensional
<Builder> oh in the intersection..
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> place 2 more blocks. 1 above the middle highest yellow, one above the right highest yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> remove that last block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> so you see that yellow block that's the highest? place a block to the right of it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> we're only building up from this point so don't worry about blocks undernearth
<Builder> here?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now switch to purple.
<Architect> looking at the structure, place 4 purple blocks each above the two highest yellow blocks. 8 purple blocks total
<Builder> two towers?

<Architect> place 2 more towers at the same elevation of the purple structure. 3 blocks tall this time instead of 2
<Architect> on the side
<Builder> which side?
<Architect> the sides of the purple structure
<Builder> oh so 4x4?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-2]
<Architect> we're making an umbrella shape.
<Architect> ok hold on
<Builder> is it all 2d?
<Architect> it is not 2 dimensional
<Architect> ok we're gonna build 1 corner of the umbrella and then I need you to mirror it in 4 directions
<Builder> got it
<Architect> so start by placing 2 red blocks towards you on the second highest red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Architect> yeah that's perfect. now 2 more red blocks. 1 underneath the one you just placed
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4]
<Architect> and one in front of that one that you juust placed

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> You're done!

<Builder> hi
<Architect> Place three blue blocks in the center of a row
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> You can start about three rows down from top
<Builder> sure
<Builder> exact center?
<Builder> or roughly?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> No it doesn't really matter there should just be enough space to build a few blocks on on all sides
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks one below the other in front of the left one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Oh sorry I didn't mean on top
<Architect> I meant next to the left one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah that's right!
<Architect> This entire structure is flat so there is no stacking at all
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks on the right of the block you're standing right in front
<Architect> right in front of
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great!
<Architect> Now put two green blocks in the center to form a 3X3 square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Cool. Now place another green block next to the green one on the right so that it juts out of the square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Perfect. Now place two green blocks behind it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> Great, this is the last step. Place two green blocks right next to the one jutting out
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> done?
<Architect> yes done!
<Builder> :)

<Architect> kk, this one is a lil crazy
<Builder> aright
<Architect> you need 7 blocks worth of space
<Architect> since thata's how big it is at its widest point
<Architect> but start by putting two red blocks 1 block apart
<Builder> k
<Builder> what corner of the structure are we starting on
<Architect> the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> it's symmetric from the center
<Architect> then put a row of 7 green blocks down, 3 on top of the blocks you put down, and then 2 hanging off both sides
<Architect> just as a single line of green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> yea like that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> from here on out all the stuff you need to do is centered from the middle
<Architect> put down 5 green blocks on top of these 7
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> then 3 blocks on top of these 5
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> then 3 YELLOW blocks on top of these 3
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> then 3 more yellow blocks on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> then 5 yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:2]
<Architect> then one red block, and we're done
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0]

B40-A14-C67-1523053894335
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Place two yellow blocks on the grid. This structure mostly goes upward so you don't need a lot of room. But don't go too close to the edges
<Builder> sounds good
<Builder> so a stack of yellow blocks?
<Architect> Sorry two next to each other
<Builder> cool
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great. Now stack another yellow one on top of the right one, and place another yellow one to the right of the stacked block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now you're going to stack three yellow blocks in a row, top on top of these and then one jutting out
<Builder> on top of which block?
<Architect> Oh sorry the two blocks you just stacked
<Builder> ah i see what you mean
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> i thought by stack you meant vertically stack
<Builder> is this what you had in mind?
<Architect> Sorry! I meant stack one on top of each
<Architect> Yes this is perfect
<Builder> ah!
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> Now stack a yellow block each on top of the center block and the right block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> just curious...what are we building?
<Architect> You stacked on the left and right. Can you move the left block to the center?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> I have no idea!
<Builder> ah my bad
<Builder> lol
<Builder> okay
<Architect> Great! Now we're going to place four purple blocks on a row on top of this. Two are stacked on the two blocks on top here
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> The other two jut out on either side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now stack four purple blocks in a row on top of this row
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> Now add a block to either side so it juts out. a row of six purple blocks total
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice! Now place four more purple blocks in a row on top of the four center blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:7 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Last step. Stack a purple block on each of the middle two blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1]
<Architect> We're done!
<Builder> gg

B24-A25-C13-1523053997650
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> aight we're live again
<Builder> lit
<Architect> this is a 2d build again, at its widest point it's gonna be 7 blocks
<Architect> first, put down 4 purple blocks in a line
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> on the 3 rightmost blocks, put down 3 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> then on the rightmost blue block, add a purple block to the right side of it
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> ok, on the left of the blue block, put a floating purple block one block apart from it
<Architect> if that doesn't make sense lmk
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> oh my bad, it should've been on the same row as the blue block
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> put one block apart from it, which would make it floating
<Architect> nah like in line with the blue blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yea like that
<Builder> kool
<Architect> put two more purple blocks ontop of the leftmost purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> put two more blue blocks on top of the leftmost blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> put a purple block on the middle blue block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> and a blue block next to that one
<Architect> next to the purple block u just put down
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> then one space apart, put another purple block to the right of the block you just put down
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> aight this is gonna get tricky, so i think from here on out we should just go row by row
<Architect> so u dont lose your mind lol
<Builder> k
<Architect> on the topmost row, the final product should be purple, purple, blue, space, purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> nah nah on the current top row
<Architect> my bad
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> purple, purple, blue, blue, space, purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> kk, row done
<Architect> next row, put two purple blocks down on top of the blue blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> then one on both sides
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> aight that row is also done
<Architect> next row only has one block, and it floats above the purple block all the way to the right of row 3
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> my bad, the floating block should be red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> and the final row is on top of that one
<Architect> it's red blocks from right to left, ending one column before that floating red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]

<Architect> yup, we're done
<Builder> dope

B40-A14-C68-1523054593793
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> You can start this one somewhat in the center, but it goes mostly upwards. Place a red block first
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Sorry I meant orange. It looked more like red at first!
<Builder> np
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Now place one diagonally below it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! Now place another one diagonal to the first one, on the right
<Builder> again below it right?
<Architect> Yup!
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great. Now place an orange block in the middle of those two blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> And then place one right below the one you just placed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> you could've said a plus sign ;)
<Architect> Great, now stack an orange block on top of the center one
<Builder> but no problem
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Haha I didn't realize there was a center block until she pointed it out
<Architect> You can't really see it here
<Builder> ah i see!
<Builder> true
<Architect> Okay now put another orange block on top of that
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> We're going to build a square around this block using green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, great!
<Architect> now place another orange block on top of the center one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Sorry place another orange block on top of this one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> another square around this one?
<Architect> Great, now we're going to make a plus sign with green blocks
<Architect> plus sign this time!
<Builder> cool
<Builder> center of the plus on top of the last orange block i placed?
<Architect> The orange block is the center sorry
<Builder> ah got it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> or is the plus bigger?
<Architect> Yes perfect! now stack two yellow blocks on top of the orange one in the center, but remove the first one so there's just one floating on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> Awesome! Ok there are a few random blocks left to place here and there
<Architect> There is a red block jutting out on the left side next to the orange block standing by itself
<Builder> which orange block?
<Architect> I think it's the third one from down
<Architect> wait fourth one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Yes except it's right next to that one. So place another one to the left and then remove this one
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> ya that's why i was a bit confused
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah sorry! Ok now we're going to do the same thing with a purple block
<Builder> np
<Architect> Place one above the orange block on the right side of the plus sign at the bottom
<Architect> You're standing in the right spot
<Builder> ya not sure which place you mean
<Architect> Sorry so the base of the structure is a plus right. Place a purple block on top of the right orange block of the plus sign
<Architect> Stack it, I mean
<Builder> right orange block of the pus sign?
<Builder> plus*
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> you mean here?
<Architect> No you have to go all the way to the bottom
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> oh this plus sign!!
<Builder> i thought the green one!
<Builder> lol
<Builder> forgot there were two plus signs
<Architect> No worries!
<Builder> ya that's why i didn't understand when you said base of the structure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah sorry i may have forgotton to say orange plus
<Architect> yes. Now place a purple one to the right of this one and then remove this one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! now go the left side of the plus sign.
<Architect> And place a blue block two squares above the one directly next to the orange block
<Architect> sorry that was confusing
<Builder> haha
<Builder> np
<Architect> so on the left side of the plus, instead of placing the blue block directly next to the orange one, place it two squares above,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> I don't know if that helps either lol
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> not sure if that's right
<Architect> It has to be down next to the base structure
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> like on the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yes that's right, but it's on the wrong side sorry. We want it on the side opposite the random purple block
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> so this side...
<Architect> yes
<Builder> now two squares above which block exactly?
<Architect> So maybe it's easier if I tell you to place it somewhere first and then move it. Place it on the ground next to the orange block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Yes now move it to the left by two squares
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes, great! now place another blue block on top of it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> phew :)
<Architect> Now remove the bottom blue one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and we're done! phew
<Builder> haha
<Builder> cool

<Architect> ok, this is a 3D figure
<Architect> 5 blocks long, 3 blocks wide
<Architect> instead of row by row, i'll go plane by plane
<Architect> first make a 3x3 cross out of red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one block apart from the left most part of the cross, put an orange block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> and then one more block apart to the left put a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> sorry, should be one space apart to the left
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect, plane 1 done
<Architect> plane 2, one yellow block on top of the orange block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> red block to the right of it
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> orange to the left of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> plane 2 done
<Architect> then put a row of 3 yellow blocks centered ontop of the yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> put an orange block on the left of that row, and a red block on the right of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> plane 3 done
<Architect> next, put a row of 3 yellow blocks from left to right starting ontop of the center yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yup, and then a red block hanging off the right side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> plane 4 done
<Architect> then, put 3 more yellow blocks from left to right on top of the center yellow block on the previous plane
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> plane 5 done
<Architect> then put 2 yellow blocks on the rightmost yellow blocks on the previous plane
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> aight we're done

B24-A25-C20-1523055406013
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
<Architect> first, put a red block down
<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
<Architect> from the one ur looking at
<Architect> yea that works
<Architect> so the red block goes there
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
<Builder> lol
<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> kk
<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> k
<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
<Builder> gotchu
<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
<Architect> just a single block
<Architect> that's just its position
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> yup
<Builder> my b
<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
<Architect> above both
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> yup
<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
<Architect> let's backtrack
<Builder> aright
<Architect> should be easy to fix,
<Architect> can u go on the other side
<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
<Builder> kk
<Architect> ok, plane 3
<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3]
<Architect> yup
<Architect> and then move the purple one back
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> should share an edge with the blue block on the right
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> we done
<Builder> sweet
<Architect> sorry about that, switching sides threw me off at some point i guess

B24-A25-C48-1523056660291
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok, this is a complex type of build
<Architect> so we'll go plane by plane again
<Builder> aright
<Architect> just start in the center of the grid, put 2 purple blocks down
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]

<Architect> this is where it gets interesting
<Architect> first put down a blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> on the same plane facing you, leave a space and then put 2 red blocks down in a row
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:7 Z:-1]

<Architect> the build is symmetric from here
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Architect> then an orange block on the left and right of each of the more inner red blocks

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-3]
<Architect> perfect, plane 7 done
<Architect> ok, put a red block on top of the blue block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one on all 4 faces
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-1]
<Architect> and then fill the gaps on that plane with 4 orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Architect> plane 8 done
<Architect> top it off with a red block and we done
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1]
<Architect> lit
<Builder> kool
