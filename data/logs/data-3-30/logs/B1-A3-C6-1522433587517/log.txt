	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?

	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?

	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one

	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up

	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect

	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that

	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that

	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first

	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
	<Builder> like this?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
	<Builder> okay

	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder!

[Chat Log]
	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder!
	<Builder> good job

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello
	<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
	<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
	<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
	<Builder> start here?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> a C?
	<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
	<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
	<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
	<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
	<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
	<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
	<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
	<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
	<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> go it
	<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
	<Architect> yes please
	<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
	<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
	<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
	<Builder> okay. here?
	<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
	<Builder> let me try
	<Builder> like this?
	<Builder> is the orientation correct?
	<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
	<Builder> so flat?
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
	<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
	<Architect> yes like that
	<Builder> extending like this?
	<Architect> very good builder
	<Builder> is that it?
	<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
	<Builder> that are perpendicular
	<Builder> then the interlocking one..
	<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder!
	<Builder> good job
