	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that

	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok

	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease

	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
	<Architect> nice
	<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
	<Architect> and then do it again
	<Architect> yes actually
	<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that

	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between

	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
	<Architect> nice
	<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
	<Architect> and then do it again
	<Architect> yes actually
	<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
	<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left

	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
	<Architect> nice
	<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
	<Architect> and then do it again
	<Architect> yes actually
	<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
	<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left
	<Architect> and one under the second one

	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
	<Architect> nice
	<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
	<Architect> and then do it again
	<Architect> yes actually
	<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
	<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left
	<Architect> and one under the second one
	<Architect> now you can get rid of blue

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hello once again architect, my only friend and parent
	<Builder> what are we building today?
	<Architect> we are building a heart
	<Builder> anatomical or figurative?
	<Architect> figurative, it looks diseased as well
	<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
	<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
	<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
	<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> you got it
	<Architect> do that twice more
	<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
	<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side
	<Architect> put a placeholder block in between
	<Architect> and then another red one below that
	<Architect> yep
	<Architect> ok time to build the disease
	<Builder> i am ready
	<Architect> switch to orange
	<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
	<Architect> nice
	<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
	<Architect> and then do it again
	<Architect> yes actually
	<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
	<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left
	<Architect> and one under the second one
	<Architect> now you can get rid of blue
	<Architect> nice, that's it
