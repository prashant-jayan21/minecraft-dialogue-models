<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is all in one vertical plane
<Architect> so you'll be building up. Start with two red blocks one space apart
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> somewhere in the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> on top of that a row of 7 forest green blocks.
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> on top of both?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> not vertically, horizontally

<Builder> like this?
<Architect> and it will be symmetric
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and yeah@!!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> kind of. do another layer of the tree (3) then it will change after that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> it kind of looks like a man in a skirt
<Architect> on top of that, three light/puke green blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]

<Architect> thats good!
<Builder> cool

B12-A26-C10-1522940187640
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> ready
<Architect> We will start on the ground, placing red-purple-yellow-yellow-purple-red in a line. Each will have a space in between
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?

[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Now in the center there should be two yellows, not just one

<Builder> alrighty
<Architect> the next layer up is similar in that you're building on the perimeter with purple blocks
<Builder> what's the difference?
<Architect> so follow the perimeter of the red on the edges with purple blocks. The overall shape will be different is the main thing.

<Builder> ready
<Architect> Sorry, there were some technical difficulties so we restarted
<Builder> no problem
<Architect> Now we'll be building broken heart object
<Builder> red?
<Architect> And so we'll start with a red brick in the middle of the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> Now on the next level we want red-blackspace-red

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> Then remove the brick above the one just added
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! We have a heart. Now let's add a broken symbol
<Architect> First, we will add three brown bricks
<Builder> will orange do?
<Builder> I have no brown
<Architect> They will be diagonal down right through the heart
<Architect> That might do, let me ask
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> It is orange

B20-A10-C5-1522940932269
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay. This one can be described as two parts. i'll start with one part, which is entirely red blocks.
<Architect> start with three red blocks next to one another
<Builder> how much space do i need to leave on the whole grid
<Architect> the whold thing is only two columns, 6 rows and then built vertically
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> cool.
<Architect> now put a red block on top of each end
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> yep. now, adjacent to the left and right of the ones you just put down, attach a red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> yep! now put a row of three red on the top and in the middle
<Builder> on top and in the middle?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yes, that's it
<Architect> the second structure will be "behind" this one, with respect to you right now
<Architect> this one is purple. Start with a purple right under you, but flush with the red strdcuture
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> one to the left, my b
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> and one in the middle
<Architect> perfect
<Builder> great
<Builder> that it?
<Architect> one sec. i'm checking to see if it's rotation invariant
<Architect> okay its right

B12-A26-C12-1522941391204
<Builder> Mission has started.
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
<Architect> Okay, this time we'll start with a diagonal line from the left corner to the center. It will be purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and then red
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:5]
<Architect> You can actually keep the L you made
<Builder> no more L's?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:2 Z:5]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> So you make the diagonal starting from the corner of the purple L
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Good job. Now repeat the same thing on the second level
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]

<Architect> Good job!

B20-A10-C6-1522941513644
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this entire structure lays on/above a footprint of a 7 by 6 gird
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> im just marking for myself
<Architect> actually, that is a really good start
<Architect> start from the top blck and make a row toward the other of four purple blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> fill in underthat as well.
<Builder> tok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> and another row on top of that of purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> and you can remove taht other one
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> okay. so on right end of the strucure, on the second level, there are red blocks kind of making a ring off the end. So i would start with a red block second from the right on the second levle of this purple thing
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> one more in the same direction
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> lay two to the right of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> now three going up from that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> and two more wrapping around the purple
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yep! next lets do the green blocks.
<Architect> okay, so basically the same thing happens on the second level with the green. except the ring is bigger on your side
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> yep!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> okay, quick change. the blocks you can't "see" in the original purple rectangle shouldnt be there.

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> or, morethey should be replaced with red and green to continue the rectangles youre building around them
<Builder> ah okay
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> great!
<Architect> the final is a blue rectangle, like the ones you just build
<Architect> *built
<Builder> where do I put it?
<Architect> it is perpindicular to the purple and green
<Architect> so start in the empty spot of the green rectangle,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> one blue on top of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> three more toward you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> two down
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> fill in the rest? or is it a ring?
<Architect> and then connect itwith three more back toward the start
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]

<Architect> okay, so the footprint of this is just 1 by 7
<Architect> then it is built vertically from there
<Architect> it is floating, so you'll need to put some blocks down to have a starting point
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> put a row of three orange blocks down

<Architect> Now we'll build another rectangle. This one will be green and its center will contain the blue and purple bricks
<Architect> So the center would look like green-blue-purple-blue
<Architect> It will interlock with the other two rectangles
<Builder> green blue purple green maybe?

<Builder> do you know the color of the obscured blocks?
<Architect> yes, the obscured blocks will be the colors of the rectangles to which they belong
<Architect> So you are doing ok
<Architect> The red rectangle will wrap around the column of the purple rectangle, and touch the green rectangle three times

<Builder> Ok,

B16-A41-C31-1522946488538
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Okay, we are going to make the word HOT. First let's make the H. It is floating one square above the ground.
<Builder> the entire H is floating?
<Builder> Also color?
<Architect> So first make a row of three blue squares, parallel to an edge of the map, a few blocks away from the corner
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> One more row on top, then delete the bottom row
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> And delete the middle blocks on the top and bottom rows to make an H
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Okay now we will make an orange O. The left hand side of the O is in front of the right hand side of the H, with one space separating them.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> No, it is in front of the H
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> No wait!
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> Okay-- sorry!
<Architect> The O is parallel to the H
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> But in front and offset to the right.
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Needs to be shifted two spaces right.
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Yes exactly!
<Builder> this hopefully?
<Architect> Sorry haha
<Builder> nice! it's alright!
<Architect> Okay, now build a 3x3 O on top, so it is floating at the same height as the H
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Yay!
<Builder> this?
<Builder> nice!
<Architect> Yes perfect. Now the T follows the same pattern - we need a row of three green blocks that starts one block in front of the right hand side of the O
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yes exactly
<Architect> Now make three more green rows and remove the bottom row, and two bottom blocks on each side to make a T
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
