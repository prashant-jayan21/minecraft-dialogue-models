B21-A15-C66-1522882961544
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ready?
<Builder> good to go
<Architect> okay, so, you're gonna want to start by placing 5 orange blocks in a row near the center
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> yep! now, you're gonna build a 2d pyramid
<Builder> is that close enought
<Architect> yeah, it's fine
<Architect> so, two orange blocks on either end
<Builder> on top?
<Architect> yeah on top, sorry
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> it'll be a vertical pyramid
<Architect> and then two more blocks up and diagonally inwards from those two
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now move to the other side of the structure
<Architect> sorry, trying to figure out how to explain this
<Architect> okay, stand right there and face right
<Architect> put a green block three spaces in front of you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> now another on top of that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> now two green blocks on either side, paralell to the orange pyramid
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> whoops, my bad
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> those should both be connected to the top block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> alright, now two more green blocks extending to the right of the top row
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now remove the bottom block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and build the exact same pyramid structure on top of those green blocks
<Architect> so it should look like the orange one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:4 Z:2]

[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Builder> is that good?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> okay, so now, place a red block on top and in front of the topmost green block, from your current perspective
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]

[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:3]
<Architect> start with a red block on top of the pyramid
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
<Architect> like that, but on the other side!
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:2]
<Architect> perfect!

[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-3]

<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, perfect!
<Builder> solid
<Architect> i messed up though
<Architect> i apologized
<Architect> the orange pyramid should be one tile to the right of where it currently is, so it's directly underneath the red pyramid's ip
<Architect> tip*
<Builder> aight
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> no

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> move one space left
<Architect> walk up against the orange pyramid
<Architect> okay, place an orange block right in front of you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and one space down
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> so underneath that
<Architect> yeah, that's the row you should rebuild the orange pyramid on

B4-A19-C10-1522883113537
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some yellow blocks
<Architect> in the center of the row, there's a floating block with z=1
<Architect> like in the xyz coordinate plane
<Builder> center of which row?
<Architect> we only need one entire row for this
<Architect> so it doesn't matter which row
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah now place two on the sides except they're on the ground, z = 0
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> ok so now two units from each yellow block on the ground, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> now place two purple blocks like before, except two units away from the yellow floating block
<Architect> meaning z =1
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4]
<Builder> on top of the other purples?
<Architect> uh no right next to the ones you just placed, one horizontal space
<Builder> so connecting the purple and yellow diagonally?
<Architect> yea
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> the on the very ends place red blocks
<Architect> the row ends
<Builder> of which row?
<Architect> the same row
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> oh sorry i meant on the ground
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> so like the yellow and the purple stack diagonally
<Architect> stack the red ones diagonally in the air
<Builder> okay how many?
<Architect> till z = 4

[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> ok we're done
<Builder> nice

B4-A19-C21-1522883588233
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Architect> ok get some purple blocks
<Architect> ok so lets think of this like a coordinate system
<Architect> place a purple block in x = 3, y =4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> now x = 4, y=4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> x = 5, y = 4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok nvm can't use coordinates
<Builder> you could just say a line too
<Architect> place one to the right one spot of the block
<Architect> you just placed
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> one space in between
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok now two blocks directly to the right of the one you just placed
<Architect> in the same row
<Builder> as in two spaces with one blank space or two blank spaces?
<Architect> no spaces
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> yeah now anotehr block to the right
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> oh another line of three
<Architect> ok yeah thats a better way to say it
<Architect> ok so on top place purple blocks alternating
<Architect> so one on each end of the line of 3
<Architect> they are floating
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> yeah like taht
